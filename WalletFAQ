- New to installing the nexus wallets.

Choose ur wallet, 2.0.5 Oracle Or LLD(2.2.3) wallet.
- Download the client software for ur OS (at download section on nexusearth.com)
- Download the blockchain file for ur Wallet Type. (at download section on nexusearth.com)

Where to place these db files? If u startup the wallet 1ste time it will auto create a nexus folder.
Close ur wallet after its booted up the first time. and extract the zip file into the following locations.
- For windows = Username/appdata/roaming/nexus
- For mac = Username/library/applicationSupport/Nexus
- Linux = root/library/nexus

Once u have extracted these files u can start the wallet again.
Please wait while its loading, check ram usage to follow up the startup.
LLD: 1.4 Gb ram
Oracle : 800-900 Mb ram

I see an LLD wallet and an Oracle wallet download option. What is the difference and which should I choose?
The LLD(2.2.2/2.2.3) wallet and the Oracle(2.0.5) wallet both operate basically the same.
The main difference is the way it stores blockchain information.
The LLD wallet uses a different type of database to store the information than the Oracle wallet.

IMPORTANT 
- The MAIN difference in function between the two is when it comes to staking (mining nPOS blocks).
The Oracle wallet is better at doing this as there is a problem with staking in the LLD wallet.
So if you plan to stake your coins, you should use the Oracle(2.0.5) wallet.
If you have no plans to stake your coins, you should use the LLD(2.2.3) wallet as it is more efficient and loads the database much faster than the Oracle wallet does.
